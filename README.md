# Simple Kanban Board

This project is an implementation of a simple Kanban board consisting of three columns: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". The goal is to allow users to create tasks and move them between the different columns of the board.

## Features

- Task Creation: Users can create tasks that consist of a description.
- Task Movement: Users can move tasks between the three columns of the board.
- Intuitive Interface: The board has a user-friendly interface that allows users to create and move tasks easily.
- Data Persistence: Created tasks are not persisted, meaning they will be lost when the browser is closed.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: Used to build the user interface of the Kanban board.
- HTML and CSS: Used to style the board and make it more appealing to users.
